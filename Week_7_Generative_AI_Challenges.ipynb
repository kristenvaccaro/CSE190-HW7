    "- Summarize a research abstract into a tweet while keeping technical accuracy.\n",
    "- Prompt an AI to explain how gradient descent works in simple terms, then in formal mathematical language.\n",
    "- Write a 100-word story where the main character is a sentient vending machine that learns to feel emotions.\n",
    "- Create a marketing tweet for a fake tech startup that sounds confident but subtly untrustworthy.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Condition 1:** They write their prompt freely in a **plain textbox** (no hints or structure).\n",
    "* **Condition 2:** You give them guidance (written, visual, interactive, etc.) — for example, a short list of reminders, a color-coded example showing how to structure a clear prompt, or an interactive checklist that asks for task, audience, and tone. This should simulates what a guided interface *might* offer.\n",
